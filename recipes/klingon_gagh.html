    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>200 grams of vermicelli noodles</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of chili flakes (optional)</li>
            <li>2 spring onions, finely chopped for garnish</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the vermicelli noodles in warm water for about 10 minutes or until they become soft. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the sesame oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chopped garlic and saut√© until it's fragrant but not browned.</li>
        <li>Add the softened vermicelli noodles to the pan. Toss them around in the oil to ensure they're fully coated.</li>
        <li>Add the soy sauce, oyster sauce, black pepper, and chili flakes (if using) to the pan. Stir well to evenly distribute the flavors.</li>
        <li>Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the noodles are heated through and have absorbed the flavors of the sauces and spices.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the heat. Plate your "Gagh", garnishing it with the chopped spring onions.</li>
        <li>Serve your "Gagh" immediately for the full "live" effect, and enjoy this playful nod to Klingon cuisine!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Please note that in the Star Trek universe, Gagh is a dish of live serpent worms.
         This recipe is a fun and safe interpretation of that concept, 
         using Earth-based, edible ingredients.</p>
