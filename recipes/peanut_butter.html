    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices of your favorite bread (white, whole grain, etc.)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of peanut butter</li>
            <li>Optional: 1 tablespoon of jelly or jam of your choice (for a PB&J sandwich)</li>
            <li>Optional: 1 banana (for a PB & banana sandwich)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay out your two slices of bread on a clean surface or plate.</li>
        <li>Spread about 1 tablespoon of peanut butter on one side of each slice of bread. Make sure to spread it evenly, all the way to the edges.
            Optional: If you're making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you can spread the jelly or jam on one slice of bread instead of the second tablespoon of peanut butter.
            Optional: If you're making a peanut butter and banana sandwich, slice the banana into thin rounds and lay them out on one slice of bread over the peanut butter.</li>
        <li>Once you've spread your peanut butter (and optional jelly or banana), press the two slices of bread together with the peanut butter (and optional jelly or banana) sides facing each other.</li>
        <li>If you like, you can cut the sandwich into halves or quarters for easier eating.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your peanut butter sandwich as is, or serve it with a side of fresh fruit, potato chips, or a glass of milk.</li>
    </ol>
