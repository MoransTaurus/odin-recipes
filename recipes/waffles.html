    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> This waffle recipe starts with two whole eggs, whisked until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li> <strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour adds gluten, which gives the waffles structure. You can also use whole wheat flour.</li>
            <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Whole milk lends richness and moisture. Plus, it helps create the ideal batter consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil:</strong> A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, ensures the waffles are nice and moist.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> A tablespoon of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking powder:</strong> Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it contributes to the waffles' light and fluffy texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the other flavors. Don't skip this step!</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> A dash of vanilla adds complexity and enhances the overfall flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooking spray:</strong> You'll need to spray the iron with nonstick cooking spray before you start making the waffles.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the batter: Whisk the eggs, then add the flour, milk, and oil. Whisk in the sugar. Stir in the remaining ingredients.</li>
